# Coffee House — Static React Coffee Shop Website ☕

A simple, clean, and responsive static website for a coffee shop built with React, HTML & CSS.  

## 🖼️ Preview (Screenshot / Demo Images)

You can include one or more images here to show what your website looks like.  
Example:

<br>
![Coffee Shop Hero Section](./images/Screenshot 1.jpg)  
<br>

> Adjust the filename and path according to where you store your images (see “🗂️ Repository Structure” below).

## 🚀 Why this project

I built this to practice building a modern, component-based frontend with React and to create a nice-looking, easily customizable coffee shop landing page / menu site.  
It’s ideal as a portfolio project, a base for a small business website, or for learning React + styling fundamentals.
